ESP32 Two-Wheel Balancing Robot with AI-Tuned PID Control
 
Introduction
Welcome to the ESP32 Two-Wheel Balancing Robot project! This repository contains code and instructions for building a self-balancing robot using the ESP32 microcontroller, BTS7960 motor drivers, and an MPU6050 IMU. Inspired by Segway-like designs, the robot maintains balance through a PID controller, with wireless tuning via a sci-fi-themed Processing GUI over WiFi. The latest upgrade introduces AI-based PID tuning using Differential Evolution in Python, simulating an inverted pendulum to optimize Kp, Ki, and Kd values before real-world deployment.
This project is perfect for robotics enthusiasts diving into control systems, IoT, and machine learning. The robot corrects tilts dynamically, and the AI tuning reduces manual effort. Whether you're a beginner or advanced maker, this guide will help you build, tune, and extend the robot. Let's get started!
Features

Hardware: ESP32 DevKit, MPU6050 IMU, BTS7960 drivers, two DC motors.
Wireless Control: WiFi-based communication with a Processing GUI for real-time monitoring and PID tuning.
AI Tuning: Python script using Differential Evolution to optimize PID parameters in a simulated inverted pendulum.
GUI: Sci-fi-themed Processing interface with neon graphs, sliders, and status indicators.
Scalable: Add encoders, Bluetooth, or real-time ML for advanced control.

Story
I built this robot to explore control theory and IoT on a budget. Initially, manual PID tuning via sliders was effective but time-consuming. Switching to BTS7960 drivers added power (up to 43A), and WiFi freed me from USB cables. The real breakthrough was AI-based tuning: I modeled the robot as an inverted pendulum in Python, using SciPy's Differential Evolution to find optimal PID values (e.g., Kp â‰ˆ 200, Ki â‰ˆ 0, Kd â‰ˆ 1.6). These stabilized the simulation, and with minor tweaks, the real robot balanced smoothly. The Processing GUI lets me monitor tilt and fine-tune wirelessly, making iterations fast and fun!
